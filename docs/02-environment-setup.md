# Environment Setup

This document outlines the steps to set up the development environment for the My Demo App project.

## 1. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

VS Code is the primary IDE used for this project.

- **Download and Install**:
  - Download VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and install it on your machine.

- **Install Recommended Extensions**:
  - Launch VS Code and install the following extensions:
    - **Python**
    - **Docker**
    - **GitLens**
    - **Markdown All in One**

- **Configure VS Code**:
  - Adjust settings such as Python interpreter path and editor preferences as needed.

## 2. Install Podman

Podman is used for containerizing the application.

- **Installation on macOS**:
  - Install Podman using Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install podman
    ```

  - Set up the Podman machine:
    ```bash
    podman machine init
    podman machine start
    ```

  - (Optional) Enable Docker CLI compatibility:
    ```bash
    alias docker=podman
    ```

- **Installation on Other OS**:
  - Follow the [official Podman installation guide](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).

- **Verify Installation**:
  ```bash
  podman --version

  ### Step 3: **Commit and Push the Documentation**

1. **Add and Commit the Documentation**:
   - Add the updated documentation file to Git:
     ```bash
     git add docs/02-environment-setup.md
     ```
   - Commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Documented VS Code, Podman, and Git setup"
     ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Push the changes to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

## 3 `.gitignore` File

The `.gitignore` file specifies files and directories that should not be tracked by Git. This helps keep the repository clean by excluding unnecessary files such as local environment settings, compiled code, and system-specific files.

#### `.gitignore` Contents

```plaintext
# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Virtual environments
venv/
.venv/

# Distribution / packaging
.Python
build/
dist/
*.egg-info/
*.egg

# Installer logs
pip-log.txt
pip-delete-this-directory.txt

# Unit test / coverage reports
htmlcov/
.tox/
.coverage
.coverage.*
.cache
.pytest_cache/

# Jupyter Notebook
.ipynb_checkpoints

# pyenv
.python-version

# VS Code files
.vscode/

# MacOS files
.DS_Store
```

__Explanation of .gitignore Entries__

**Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files**: Excludes Python bytecode files and any compiled Python extensions.
**Virtual environments**: Excludes directories for virtual environments to avoid committing local environment-specific files.
**Distribution / packaging**: Excludes files related to Python packaging, which are generated during the build process.
**Installer logs**: Excludes logs generated by pip during installation.
**Unit test / coverage reports**: Excludes directories and files related to unit testing and code coverage.
**Jupyter Notebook**: Excludes automatically generated backup files from Jupyter Notebooks.
**pyenv**: Excludes .python-version, a file used by pyenv to specify Python versions.**VS Code files**: Excludes configuration files specific to Visual Studio Code, which are not needed in the repository.
**MacOS files**: Excludes .DS_Store, a system file generated by macOS.
