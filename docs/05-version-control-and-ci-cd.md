# 5. Version Control and CI/CD
In this section, I’ll outline the version control practices I’m using for the My Demo App project and provide an introduction to Continuous Integration (CI) using Tekton. This will also lay the groundwork for future Continuous Deployment (CD) processes, which I plan to implement as I progress to an OpenShift environment.

## 5.1 Version Control with Git

### 5.1.1 Repository Structure
The project is version-controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub. Here’s how I’ve organised the repository:

```plaintext
my-demo-app/
├── docs/                        # Documentation files
├── src/                         # Source code for the application
│   ├── backend/                 # Backend code (Flask application)
│   │   ├── app.py               # Main application entry point
│   │   ├── config.py            # Configuration settings for the application
│   │   ├── extensions.py        # Extensions like SQLAlchemy
│   │   ├── models.py            # Database models
│   │   ├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
│   │   ├── migrations/          # Database migration files
│   │   ├── database/            # Database-related scripts or files
│   ├── frontend/                # Frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
│   │   ├── templates/           # HTML templates
│   │   ├── static/              # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
├── .gitignore                   # Files and directories to be excluded from version control
├── Dockerfile                   # Dockerfile for containerising the application
└── README.md                    # Project overview and setup instructions
```

### 5.1.2 Git Practices Used

To keep the codebase clean and manageable, I’m following these Git best practices:

- **Commit Frequently**: Commit changes often with clear and descriptive messages.
- **Branching Strategy**: Use feature branches for new features, bug fixes, or experiments. Merge into the main branch via pull requests.
- **Code Reviews**: All changes should be reviewed before being merged into the main branch.
- **Tagging Releases**: Use Git tags to mark specific releases or milestones in the project.

### 5.1.3 Setting up the Repository
To setup the repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-demo-app.git
cd my-demo-app
```

2. **Check Out a New Branch**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

3. **Add and Commit Changes**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
```

4. **Push Changes to GitHub**:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## 5.2 Preparing for Continuous Integration with Tekton

### 5.2.1 Introduction to Tekton

Tekton is a Kubernetes-native CI/CD solution that I’ll be using to automate the build and test processes for My Demo App. Even though I haven’t deployed to an OpenShift environment yet, setting up Tekton pipelines now will provide a strong foundation for future CI/CD implementations.

### 5.2.2 Initial Setup on a Local Environment

Since I’m currently working on a local environment (like a spare laptop running Single Node OpenShift (SNO)), I can start experimenting with Tekton by setting up a minimal pipeline:

   - **Install Tekton Pipelines**: I need to ensure that Tekton Pipelines are installed on my local OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.
   - **Create Basic Tekton Tasks**: I’ll start with simple tasks, such as checking out the code from GitHub and running basic tests.

### 5.2.3 Expanding CI with Tekton on OpenShift

Once I transition to a more robust environment like ROSA, I plan to expand my Tekton pipelines to include more complex tasks, such as:

   - **Building Docker Images**: Automating the build process for my Docker images.
   - **Running Tests**: Integrating my testing framework into the pipeline to ensure code quality.

## 5.3 Future Considerations for Continuous Deployment

### 5.3.1 Planning for Deployment

When I’m ready to deploy my application to an OpenShift environment, I’ll expand my Tekton pipelines to include deployment tasks. This will likely involve:

   - **Deploying to OpenShift**: Using oc commands or Kubernetes manifests to deploy my application.
   - **Running Migrations**: Applying database migrations as part of the deployment proces

### 5.3.2 Incorporating GitOps with Argo CD

As I gain more experience with OpenShift, I’m considering integrating GitOps practices using Argo CD. This approach will allow me to manage deployments declaratively, with Git as the single source of truth.
